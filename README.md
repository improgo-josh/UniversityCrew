## Overview
### Description
This is a college-based app where college students are able to eliminate the social unease of talking to students within their classes. This app allows students to be linked to their own class and the students who have the app will be able to select their class and share notes, message for any upcoming tests or reminders or important announcements that their professors have made. This app also allows for club meetings and events as reminders in their own calendar.
